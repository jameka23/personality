        <!-- Intro -->
        <div class="intro cards">
            <p>Defenders are true altruists, meeting kindness with kindness-in-excess and engaging the
                    work and people they believe in with enthusiasm and generosity.</p>
            <p>What I identify with:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>"They have a tendency to underplay their accomplishments.."</li>
                <li>"Naturally social, an odd quality for Introverts.."</li>
                <li>Defender personalities (especially Turbulent ones) are often meticulous to the point of perfectionism, 
                    and though they procrastinate, they can always be relied on to get the job done on time.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!-- Strength & Weaknesses -->
        <div class="strength cards">
                <p>"The meek shall inherit the earth, but it’s a long road if they receive no recognition at all."</p>
                <p>What I identify with:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>"Defenders not only ensure that things are done to the highest standard, but often go well beyond what is required."</li>
                    <li>"Defenders are the universal helpers, sharing their knowledge, experience, time and energy with anyone who needs it"</li>
                    <li>"Their strong senses of duty and perfectionism combine with this aversion to emotional conflict to create a situation where it is far 
                        too easy for Defenders to overload themselves – or to be overloaded by others – as they struggle silently to meet everyone’s expectations, especially their own."</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

        <!-- Friendships -->
        <div class="friendships cards">
                <p>"A lot of what establishes and deepens Defenders’ friendships is the 
                    mutual support, advice and reassurance that the friends give each other."</p>
                <p>What I identify with:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>"Defenders need a lot of positive feedback,.."</li>
                    <li>"Defenders aren’t particularly picky about what personality types they make friends with.."</li>
                    <li>"Defenders’ sense of loyalty may push them to lean ever more on themselves 
                        to meet their friends’ needs, to the point of neglecting their own.."</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

        <!-- Career Path -->
        <div class="career-path cards">
                <p>"Whether they seek promotion or not it happens often enough, as Defenders’ ability to implement 
                    ideas and “create order from chaos” is bound to make an impression."</p>
                <p>What I identify with:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>"Defenders are skilled at remembering things about others which makes them not only valuable assistants, but well-liked colleagues."</li>
                    <li>"Defender personalities prefer to be rewarded by seeing first-hand the positive impact of their efforts.."</li>
                    <li>"Defenders are well-tuned to others’ emotions and have a strong sense of practicality, extending their own ability to get things done to their teams".</li>

            </div>

        <!-- Workplace Habits -->
        <div class="work-habits cards">
                <p> "Win-win situations are Defenders’ bread and butter, and no one takes quite the 
                    same pleasure in finding satisfying resolutions to day-to-day challenges."</p>
                <p>What I identify with:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>"Defenders are warm, approachable and great listeners."</li>
